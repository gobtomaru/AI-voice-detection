# AI-voice-detection
A lightweight supervised learning pipeline to distinguish AI-generated from human-recorded speech using prosodic, spectral, and acoustic features. Despite only 79 samples (as of August 2025), it overcomes data sparsity through feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and Monte Carlo cross-validation.
